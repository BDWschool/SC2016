Water is fluid. Other things can pass through it. 

When something stays on the surface of the water, we say it is positively buoyant. A balloon is positively buoyant.

When something doesn't stay at the surface, we say it is negatively buoyant. A coin is negatively buoyant.

If something stays in the middle of the water and doesn't sink or float, we say it is neutrally buoyant. Fish are nuetrally buoyant.

Some things like eggs sink in fresh water and float in salt water. The salt water is more dense and can keep the thing on the surface better.
