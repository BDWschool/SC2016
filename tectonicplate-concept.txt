Earth is like an onion. It has many layers. 

The outer layer is the crust. It is many pieces, called plates, that float on top of liquid rock called lava. The plates are always moving. 

When plates grind against each other, they make earthquakes. Earthquakes under the ocean can make tsunamis. 

When plates [push together/converge], the rock pushes up making mountains. 

When plates [move away/diverge] from each other, the lava under them pushes up and makes volcanos.

Some volcanos are under the ocean. The lava that comes out of them builds up on the bottom of the ocean. Sometimes it builds up very high. It rises out of the water and makes an island. 

Earth is always transforming and changing.
