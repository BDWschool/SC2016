How do magnets work?

Magnets can move things without touching them!

Magnets can pull metal.

Magnets push or pull other magnets.

One end of a magnet is north. 
The other end is south.

North and south pull together.
Two norths or two souths push each other away. 

Earth is a magnet too! A compass always points north and south.
