Molecules of water act like glue and stick to each other and other things. We call this "surface tension". 

Where the surface of the water meets the edge of a glass, it curves up, sticking to the glass.

Surface tension can be so strong that some heavy things can even sit on the surface of water without breaking it. The water will curve near the thing too.

If you fill the glass to the top, the water will form a dome higher than the top of the glass. The water bonds together and doesn't let go of other water. 

Water drops on a window bond together too. When two drops get close, they make a bigger drop. If the new drop is too heavy, then it runs down the window.
