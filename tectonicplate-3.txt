Earth has many layers. 

The outer layer is the crust. The crust is many pieces that float and move on top of liquid rock called lava.

When pieces grind against each other, they make earthquakes. Earthquakes under the ocean can make tsunamis. 

When pieces converge, the rock pushes up and makes mountains. They are usually in a line.

When pieces diverge, the lava pushes up and makes volcanos.

Some volcanos are under the ocean. The lava that comes out of them can rise out of the water and makes land. 

Earth is always changing.
