Water sticks to itself and other things. 

The surface of the water bends when it touches the side of a glass.

Some things can sit on the surface of water without breaking it.

If a glass is too full, the water will make a dome higher than the top of the glass.

Drops on a window bond together too. When two drops touch, they make a big drop. Big drops run down the window.
