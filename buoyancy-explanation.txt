Squeezing the bottle causes the diver to sink because the increased pressure forces water up into the diver, compressing the air at the top of the straw. This increases the mass, and density, of the diver causing it to sink. Releasing the squeeze decreases the pressure on the air at the top of the straw, and the water is forced back out of the diver.
A fish does the same thing. It takes air from the water and inflates it's air bladder. This makes it float. When the fish wants to sink, it releases that air. This is why you can see fish blow bubbles!
