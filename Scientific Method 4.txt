The scientific method gives scientists steps that help them discover new things or answer tricky questions. 

1. Ask a Question: Scientists start with a question that needs answering. 

2. Do some Research: Scientists try to learn everything they can before doing an experiment. 

3. Form a Hypothesis: Scientists make their best guess about the answer to their question. 

4. Do the Experiment: They design and complete a fair test to find the real answer to their question. 

5. Collect and Record the Data: With test completed, scientists organize the data so others can understand it. 

6. Summarize and Share the Results: Scientists ask other scientists to do the test and see if they get the same results. 

When scientists follow these steps, they can safely investigate almost any question they might have.
