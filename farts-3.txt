Where do farts come from?

The gas in farts can come from many places. Swallowing air, things in our stomach, and our blood can all make farts. An easy way is in the foods we eat. 

Our stomach has liquid in it. When we eat some solid or liquid foods, they digest in our stomach and create bubbles. Small bubbles join with other bubbles until we "have gas".

That gas travels through our belly until it finally reaches our buttâ€¦ and then we fart. 

Everybody does it and it's okay. Let it rip!
