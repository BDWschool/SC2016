Air is all around us. We can't see air, but we can feel it and we can see things move because of it. 

We call moving air "wind". We feel wind blowing on our faces. 

Wind can be so light that we can't feel it. It is calm. 

Heavy wind can be dangerous. It can break trees and houses. This is a hurricane. 

Most wind is moderate. A light breeze or gale is nice.
