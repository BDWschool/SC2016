Water has a special feature called "cohesion". The atoms of water act like glue and try to stick to each other and other things. We call this "surface tension". 

You can see this by looking at a glass/ of water. Where the surface of the water meets the edge of the glass/bottle, it curves up. 

If you carefully fill a glass the water will form a bubble higher than the top of the glass. 

Surface tension can be so strong that some things can rest on the surface of the water without breaking it.
