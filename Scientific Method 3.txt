The scientific method gives scientists steps that help them discover new things or answer tricky questions. 

1. Ask a Question.
We start with a question that needs answering. Usually, it starts with "What ifâ€¦?"

2. Learn this!
Then, we try to learn everything we can about our question. This prepares us for our experiment. 

3. Make a guess!
Once we've learned some things, we make our best guess about the answer to our question. 

4. Do the Experiment: 
Now, the fun begins! We design and complete a fair test to find the real answer to our question. 

5. Write it down.
With test completed, we organize the data so others can understand it. Did we guess correctly?

6. Tell another scientist. 
Finally, we ask other scientists to do the test and see if they get the same results. 

When we follow these steps, we can safely investigate almost any question we might have.
