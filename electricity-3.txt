We use electricity everyday. 

Some electricity turns a motor, while other electricity lights a bulb. Switches turn things on and off. 

We plug some things like TVs and computers into an outlet. This electricity comes from somewhere far away.

Other things use batteries. Batteries are different metals and liquid that make electricity. With batteries, we can use our mobile phones anywhere. 

Some electricity is very dangerous. It can shock and hurt us. We must always be careful when using electricity.
