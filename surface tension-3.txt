Molecules of water stick to each other and other things. This is "surface tension". 

When the surface of the water touches the side of a glass, it curves up.

Surface tension can be so strong that some heavy things can sit on the surface of water without breaking it.

If a glass is too full, the water will make a dome higher than the top of the glass. The water bonds together like glue. 

Water drops on a window bond too. When two drops touch, they make a bigger drop. If the new drop is too heavy, it runs down the window.
