Magnets attract certain metals. They have two poles that attract or repel the poles of other magnets. Magnets work in predictable ways, making them reliable and valuable tools.

A compass always points north. That's because Earth has a magnetic field. It's a really big magnet! Like any magnet, Earth also has a north magnetic pole and a south magnetic pole. Earth's magnetic field is very helpful.

Earth's magnetic field comes from inside the planet. Way down, it's really hot. It's so hot that iron is a liquid, and it is always moving. The motion of the iron produces a magnetic field.
