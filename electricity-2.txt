We use electricity everyday. 

Electricity turns a motor. Electricity also lights a bulb. 

Switches turn things on and off. 

We plug TVs and computers into an outlet. This electricity comes from far away.

Mobile phones use batteries. We can use our mobile phones anywhere. 

Some electricity is very dangerous. It can shock us. We must be careful when using electricity.
