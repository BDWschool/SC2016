Living things can grow. 
Living things can feel. 
Living things can have babies. 
Many living things move on their own. 

Nonliving things do not grow. 
Nonliving things do not feel. 
Nonliving things do not have babies. 
Nonliving things do not move on their own. 

Living things breathe and eat food and drink water. 

Shelter keeps living things warm, dry, and safe. 

You are a living thing too.
