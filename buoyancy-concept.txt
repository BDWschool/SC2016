Water is fluid. Other things can pass through it. 

When something stays on the surface of the water, we say it floats/is positively buoyant. 

When something doesn't stay at the surface, we say it sinks/is negatively buoyant. 

If something stays in the middle of the water and doesn't sink or float, we say it hovers/is neutrally buoyant. 

Some things sink in fresh water and float in salt water. The salt water is more dense and can buoy/keep the thing on the surface better.
