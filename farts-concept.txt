Where do farts come from?

The gas in farts can come from many places. Swallowing air, bacteria in our gut, and gas from our blood can all make farts. A common way is in the foods we eat. 

The liquid in our stomach is an acid. When we eat certain foods called bases, they mix with our stomach acid. This can create gas. 

That gas travels through our intestines until it finally reaches our buttâ€¦ and then we fart. 

Everybody does it and it's perfectly natural. Let it rip!
