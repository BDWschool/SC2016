Where do farts come from?

The gas in farts can come from many places. Swallowing air, bacteria in our stomach, and gas from our blood can all make farts. A common way is in the foods we eat. 

The liquid in our stomach is an acid. When we eat certain solid or liquid foods, they digest in our stomach acid and create bubbles. Small bubbles join with other bubbles until you "have gas".

That gas travels through our intestines until it finally reaches our buttâ€¦ and then we "pass gas" or fart. 

Everybody does it and it's perfectly natural. Let it rip!
