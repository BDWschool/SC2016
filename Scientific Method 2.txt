1. What ifâ€¦
We always start by asking a question. 

2. Learn this!
Then, we learn as much as we can about our question. 

3. Guess!
Once we've learned some things, we make a guess about the answer to our question. 

4. Test it!
Now, the fun begins! We can try some stuff to find the real answer to our question. 

5. Write it down.
Here, we write down the answer to our question. 

6. Tell a friend. 
Finally, we tell our friend what we've found and ask them to test it too.
