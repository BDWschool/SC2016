We use electricity everyday. 

Computers, televisions, and mobile phones all use electricity. 

Some electricity turns a motor in a fan, while other electricity makes a light bulb work. Switches turn these things on and off. 

We plug some things like TVs into a socket. This electricity comes from somewhere far away. Wind, water, and even the sun can make this electricity. 

Other things work because of batteries. Batteries are a special mix of metals and liquid that make electricity. With batteries, we can use our mobile phones anywhere. 

Some electricity is very dangerous. It can shock and hurt us. We must always be careful when using electricity.
