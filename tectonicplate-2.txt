Earth has many layers. 

The top layer is the crust. The crust floats on lava.

When the crust grinds against other crust, it makes earthquakes. 

When the crust pushes together, the rock makes mountains.

When the crust moves away, the lava pushes up and makes volcanos.

Some volcanos are under the ocean. The lava can rise out of the water and makes land. 

Earth is always changing.
