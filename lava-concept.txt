Lava

Solids, liquids, and gases

Have you ever seen a volcano on television? Lava shoots from the top of the volcano. The lava is so hot that it's orange and red. It runs like a river.

Lava is melted rock. It comes from deep inside Earth. Far down inside Earth, it's so hot that rock melts into a liquid.

After lava pours out of the volcano, it starts to cool. It's bright colour fades. Then it becomes solid rock.

Some volcanos are under the ocean. The lava that comes out of them builds up on the bottom of the ocean. Sometimes it builds up very high. It rises out of the water and makes an island. 

When liquid rock changes to solid rock, new land is made.
