When you stretch an rubber band, it creates tension that pulls toward your hands. If you let go of one end, it snaps toward the other end. The released band doesn't get pushed, it gets pulled.

Water does the same thing to your boat. When your boat is sitting on top of the water, the surface tension of the water pulls the same on all sides, so your boat doesn't move.

When you touch the middle notch of your boat with dish soap, the surface tension becomes weak in that spot. Just like the released rubber band, your boat gets pulled forward.

Once the dish soap and water are completely mixed the boat won't move. Change the water and start again.
