Air is all around us. We can't see air, but we can feel it and we can see things move because of it. 

When air moves, we call it wind. We feel wind blowing on our faces. 

Sometimes, the wind is so light that we can't feel it. It is calm. 

Other times, heavy wind can be dangerous, breaking trees and houses. This is a hurricane. 

Most wind is moderate and nice, either as a light breeze or strong gale. 

Wind helps plants grow by spreading seeds. It also helps us make electricity.
