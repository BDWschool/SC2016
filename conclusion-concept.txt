You did a science test. Write a conclusion.

What did you learn? What do you still want to learn?



Conclusions

Your test has the steps:
Question
Prediction
Experiment
Record data
Results
Conclusion

After an experiment, draw a conclusion. Explain what you learned. Did it answer your questions? Tell about what happened in your test. Did it match your prediction?

Your conclusion also tells about your experiment. Did it work well? Could you make it better next time?

Sometimes you get new ideas from your conclusion. You might ask more questions. Each new idea can help you learn more about science!



Conclusions

A good science experiment includes the steps:
Ask a question.
Make a hypothesis.
Do the experiment and make observations.
Record data.
Look at the data and find patterns.
Draw a conclusion.

After an experiment, you tell the answer to your science question. This is called drawing a conclusion.

Be sure your conclusion is reasonable. Only tell what really happened.

Sometimes the results will not match your hypothesis. That's OK. This happens to the best scientists, too. But do not change your hypothesis. Instead, tell why you think you did not get the results you expected.

Your conclusion will also tell about your experiment. Did it work? How could you do it better?

Drawing a conclusion can lead to more questions. It can lead to new experiments. It can lead to learning more about science!
